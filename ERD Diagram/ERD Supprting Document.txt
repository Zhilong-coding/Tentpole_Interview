# Supporting Document for the ERD Diagram

With Relational Database and SQL Server chosen for this proposal:

For simplicity and performance concern I have created 5 tables:
-Regions
-Users
-Roles
-RegionalRoles
-RegionalUserRoles

We can proceed to create Users, Roles and Regions as we wish.

Then we can link specific roles to each regions if they choose to have
different roles or permission for these roles in each region.

Once the roles for each region is defined and linked, we can proceed with
linking the RegionalRoles to the Users. This can verify the User for each region and the roles it has for the region.

For Data we can verify the permision on a RegionalRole level that can be assign to each users as stated above.

Lastly for global tenant, linking Users to multiple RegionalRoles will be able to fulfill the requirement of accessing all regions data.

This solution is highly scalable as adding new tenant and users are easy and simple.
Adding new fields are less complex as the solution uses a Junction Table for linking data.
