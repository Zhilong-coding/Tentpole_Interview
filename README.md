# Assumptions:
The document provided did not state what was needed to be stored, therefore assuming we want to save the customer's full name and date of birth. The application will save the data into a "Login.xlsx" excel file in the "Data" folder.

# Prerequisite

# How to run:
Open CMD in the cloned directory
Run the below commands
1. Pip install -r requirements.txt
2. set FLASK_APP=server
